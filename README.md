# Data-Structures-Program4-Stack-Based-Calculator

This project was written in C++ for my data structures course at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. The goal of this project was to take a user input equation, add it to a stack, and then pop it off the stack to evaluate it. I made the use of two stacks to achieve this goal.
